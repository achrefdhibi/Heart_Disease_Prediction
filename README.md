# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This project aims to develop a heart disease prediction model using machine learning techniques. 
## Techniques Used

- **Random Forest**: An ensemble-based model that utilizes multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions.
- **Logistic Regression**: A regression model used for binary classification, particularly useful for predicting the presence or absence of diseases.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: In-depth analysis of patients' medical features and heart disease diagnoses.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.
3. **Modeling**: Training prediction models using machine learning techniques.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Measuring model performance using metrics such as accuracy and ROC curve.
5. **Model Saving**: Saving trained models for future use.

## Dependencies

This project uses Python along with common libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and modeling.

## Usage

This project can serve as a starting point for developing more advanced heart disease prediction systems or for exploring machine learning techniques in the medical field.
